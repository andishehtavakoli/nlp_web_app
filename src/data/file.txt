I'm wording. It's kind of out, you know, out of our way. Things will settle down. I would assume. I know just in my conversations with Mariam and Anthony that they're sort of flying by the sea of their pants just based on what information they're getting from CNB. So I know a little bit as out of their out of their control just because they're trying to do as much as they kind of head of time without a lot of information from CNB. So and from what I hear CNB's onboarding press does is somewhat manual. So they're kind of working their way through it, which is probably why a lot of people haven't received the onboarding emails yet. There's other people on other teams that also have not received them. So don't feel like it's just you or you know just our team. Mariam advice just to kind of wait and see what happens today and into tomorrow morning. And then we can follow up if we don't get anything maybe by midday tomorrow. Type of thing. I do know that they are looking at that onboarding sheet that's in addition to the PTO tracker now and monitoring that like she said in the email. They'll look at it throughout the day. So I'm sure if they see a bunch of people who still haven't gotten anything, they'll probably proactively reach out to CNB. But I will definitely keep you guys updated with whatever I hear in that regards. I got mine. So I've done everything. I was talking to Katie this afternoon and it's pretty straightforward. It's the fingerprinting is probably the easiest. You get a link. You click on that link. It takes you to I can't remember the name of it now. But a site you put in your zip code. It offers you different locations. So you pick the location where you want to go and then you pick your day and your time. And then it sends you a reminder with all your info. It tells you everything you need to bring which is basically two forms of ID. And then you go to your appointment. Mine was at a UPS store. So pretty convenient as far as hours and staffing and all that. Very fast. They take a photo like your driver's license photo. And she asked you if you want to take a new one or whatever. But you get like three little variations. So I doubt anybody other than CNB is going to see it. So I don't think it much matters. But you have your choice. And then she does fingerprinting and you just kind of put your fingers on a digital screen. It looks like glass screen. Like when you're going on an airplane and they scan your phone. That's what it looks like. So you put your fingers on. They take your prints and then they do rolling prints and then you're out of there. Done. So that's probably the quickest to set up. And then maybe it's a five to ten minute appointment. Depending. It'll depend on how busy your location is. But and then the online form for the background check is really just maybe five minutes, five, ten minutes. It's all your just your demographic information. Any names you've had previously addresses for the last four years. You know, all that kind of stuff. I don't think there's anything I had to look up. So it's all just stuff you know. And maybe unless you don't remember the address you know or something like that from four years ago. But so I'll pretty straightforward. The confidentiality is a two-pager. Just read that over and then you can type your name in to print it in the date and then Mary and sent instructions on how to sign a PDF if you haven't done it before. But then you just send that off. Email that off to the HR and you're good to go. Just copy me on that email so that I have it and then I'll update the onboarding worksheet. That was one of the things that they had asked us to go over today. On this call is kind of the status of all the onboarding. But other than add-on, I don't think anybody's received the email right. And then we've got it yet. I just received mine. Oh you did. Okay good. Yes. All right. So good. So I will mark that at least complete that you've got the email and then it'll show it's in progress. So that's good. And then add-on you're probably just working through some of those items on there. I just let me. I did the background check and everything and fingerprint is strong. So it's good to go now. Oh good. When's your fingerprinting appointment? I had a morning. I could have enjoyed the morning today. Oh today? Oh okay good. So it's all done. Perfect. That's awesome. Okay. All right. And then the meetings that you guys I skipped the agenda. Sorry. I'm a lot of order but I don't know anything more than you guys do as far as the engagement goes. Those calls that are scheduled. I have my mind calendar too. We have not had any team lead calls or any new information coming through. So I am on a chat with team leads. So sometimes there's questions that other people will ask and we kind of pop them around in that chat. So if you have questions, let me know. You know I can find answers for you or maybe somebody's already asked that question and I can like tell you right away what's going on. If not, we'll escalate it up and I can send them to Maryam and Anthony to help and then you saw well actually I think it was in a team lead email. Any questions that we can't resolve they'll cycle up to CNB. So if you have any questions, doesn't matter what just let me know. We'll figure it out. And then I think that's it. I'm just looking at my tracker thing here. I think that's pretty much it on engagement updates. I haven't seen an engagement code yet. Although you guys were on those calls. We were told the fingerprinting, the time it takes to fingerprint, the time to do the background check and all that can be billable to CNB. I guess just track it for right now. Hopefully we have an engagement code before Friday when we do our time sheets. But if not, we'll ask the question of how they want us to handle it and if we need to go back and adjust. So we'll just kind of be patient on that one. Any questions for me so far? Either on anything I guess because we haven't really gotten very far into work stuff. All right. One of the other things that I was asked is to kind of get your guys his feedback on the trainings. So the KPMG trainings we've done so far. And I can word things nicely. So feel free to be honest. If you hated it, it was boring. I mean, I can spin it so that it sounds politically correct. But I do think the feedback is valuable to them. I don't know. I know consulting does engagements like this all the time. So I know we ramp up on a short notice sometimes. But I still think feedback is good if you felt that there's you know too much time in between when you got pulled for this engagement and when it's starting. I mean, I kind of feel that way a little bit. Some of that's out of KPMG's control. But the feedback is good because then they can start to try to tweak things. And maybe the timing was just bad on this one or you know, whatever. But whatever you guys think if the presentations were boring or the whatever. And you're welcome to email me if you want. If you don't want to say it now. But if you have any feedback now, I'll jot it down to provide to them. I think that the presentations were very informative. I think that one thing just maybe like looking forward was that there was a bit of overlap. I guess like some of the presenters weren't like in the other meetings. So like for example, the second presenter, he like spent like 10 minutes on acronyms, which we already discussed in the first one. So I think just a little bit of overlap in that regard. But it didn't take away from like the quality I guess. Yeah. I hear what you're saying. I do think too that all of the presenters are familiar with the content overall. But I felt like maybe there were a couple presenters that hadn't looked at the presentation before they were giving the presentation. So I mean, granted, if you're in that area, you know, and you're like, oh, I can talk about this all day, then you probably feel like you've got it. But just taking a few seconds to read the slide is kind of a little distracting in my opinion. So anything else? I think it would be a little bit more beneficial if it was a little bit more interactive. Like I felt like a lot of the time they were kind of just going over the slides. And maybe they could have done more polls or like more just like thinking out loud sort of of like events and pieces. Yeah, I like that. Maybe more dialogue and discussion in some way. Okay. I agree. I think even like if we kind of incorporated like breakout rooms, for example, and had like discussions, like smaller group discussions could have been helpful. On that note, I remember on the first day, we were supposed to have like an activity where we were all supposed to like come up with like different plans. But since we ran out of time, we couldn't like do it. And I feel like that activity been really helpful because I remember the question was really interesting. I think something like how we would like each like money longer like an X amount of money. So I think that actually could have been fun and it would have been kind of creative as well. Yeah, I think that's great feedback. I really liked that activity when I saw it in the presentation. I was disappointed that we did not have time to do it because I thought it looked fun. You know, just like, hey, let's just pretend that we want to month longer money. Like what would you do? It's just kind of a break from even just the knowledge check. You know, like you said, it's just a little more creative, you know, dialogue. That would have been a really good way to incorporate a breakout room to a Maya to your suggestion. All right. Well, if you think of anything else, feel free to send it my way. I'm happy to provide it to them. I do believe Anthony, when he says they're really interested in tweaking this, I think that they want to make it as informative and interesting as possible. So if they have to do this again, I'm sure they're interested in the feedback. All right. Oh, let's see what else is on this agenda. Oh, the introductions for sure. If I remember right, I can't remember somebody's got to leave early. Is it you add down? Do you have to leave early? No, I got a little bit sunny. Okay. All right. It was we. So let's get with introductions then because I think the rest of the stuff, like if we talk about best practices or how we want to work together, I can send that out to everybody. So introductions, I think are valuable just because for sure, from my perspective, the only person that I have even interacted with up until now is Katie. So Katie did a couple rotate while M&T rotation is really where we worked a lot on the mobilization and transition team. So but never really worked closely with her. So and I'm not familiar with anybody else. So I just really think it's helpful to get an idea of of who we all are as people. And you can talk about, you know, whatever's on your slide, whatever you want to throw in there, feel free to share. And just to kick it off because I know sometimes it's hard to go first. Unless we have a volunteer, I'm happy to go first with my slide. All right. So I don't see the hands raised. So I will go ahead and share my screen. Let me figure out how to there we go. Okay. So let me know when you guys can see it. Okay. Great. So it feels a little busy, but I was trying to kind of get everybody in there and give you a snapshot of what my life is like right now. Very heavily focused on children, as you can see. So I have, I'm a family. We have a family of six. My husband and myself. And then we have our oldest son. So I'll just put it here in the family picture. He's the one in the middle and the football uniform. He's 17. He's finishing his junior year in high school. And then these three are 14. So we have triplets along with the 17 year old. They're finishing their eighth grade year. So next year will be my one and only year with everyone in high school. So it should be interesting. It's it's total chaos pretty much all the time in our house. It's gotten a lot better as I've gotten older, but we are really just kind of winging at day by day. There's so many different things going on. As you can see, all of my children are involved in sports. The boys play three. They play basketball, football, and baseball. So we're in baseball season right now. My son here in the tie die shirt, his name is Brock. And then jagers in the hat. So they're over here. Jagers playing baseball, bracks, playing baseball. And then I've got their football pictures. And then their basketball pictures here. And then my daughter, Presley and the cowboy hat, she plays volleyball and basketball. So between them, they were going from there's very little downtime for them. Unfortunately, my son here in the hat, Jager, he also plays travel baseball. So we're constantly going. There's multiple things going on. Multiple teams are happening. My husband is the head baseball coach at Davenport University, which is a division two school here in Caledonia. So he coaches baseball. And then he also coaches the school baseball team for these two boys. And he coaches my son's travel ball team. So baseball is his life. But that's all just to tell you. There's just a ton going on. Everybody's super active. My oldest son is Cade. And he is, he's decided to only focus on football this year. Last year was the first year in school history that they went to. Oh no, I'm sorry, it's not. I think they've gone one other time before. But they went to the state finals for football. He got to play at Ford Field. He's the starting center. And I think after that season, he just said, you know, football is my sport. I'm going to not play baseball anymore. Focus on that. You want to play in college. So he's now full in football mode. Which is funny because it's not funny. But so Cade is now six to anyways, 270. He was born prematurely at four pounds. And he's now huge. And then these guys are all, you know, they, I have wedged shoes on in this picture because I'm by far the shortest in my family now. They were all born early too. So they were not quite as early as Cade. They were about 31 weeks. They were almost full term. But I was on bad rest for quite a long time with them. So anyway, they were all born small. Under, you know, Brock actually was the heaviest. He was five pounds. So five pounds and under. And they're now all just really big thriving kids. So. And then we have two pets. Thankfully, we're all adults. But we have Tito and Malibu aren't cats. I'm sure you guys can figure out how those names came about. But that's it. We just are busy all the time. Lots of kids stuff, lots of family stuff. Yeah, I like to have my regular schedule because I like to do all my family stuff. That's why I work so. So that's it. That's me in a nutshell. That's fine. Anybody else like to go? Or you have any questions? I'm happy to answer them. But I don't think I'm that interesting. Other than it's from things for students or sports events. What's your favorite hobby? Oh, yeah. So I am a couple. I actually like I'm so the funny thing is I'm an only child. So I have no siblings. So it's kind of crazy to me to have all of this. But I like to read. I like to exercise. I used to. I haven't done it in a long time. But I like to draw. I just don't have the time to do it now. But yeah, some creative things. I like construction and building a lot. So I like things. I like to see things built from the ground up. But I also like to do kind of like the floor planning. And so I guess a little bit more of the creative stuff. What I'm sorry. My son just walked in. I like football. Yeah, I love chemistry. Oh, I'm not talking about you. Okay, all right. Go away. I'm on the call. Thank you. My first year can get. I'll get it for you in a minute. Okay. All right. Who would like to go next? I would like to go next. I have to help off pretty soon. Perfect. All right. Can everyone see that? Cool. Hi, Ron. My name is Hui. I am from the Kansas City office. I work in the accounting advisory services practice. And I've been with the firm for seven months. And so going from left to right, some of my hobbies are I picked up photography within this past year. And I super enjoyable. Still super confused about all the dials and stuff on the camera. But I think it's very fun and enjoyable. And then top left is a picture with me. My family playing tennis. This is a pandemic hobby that I acquired. And it kicks my butt every single time I play. I got an injured plane, but enjoy it nonetheless. And then a big thing that I like to do is being outdoors no matter what what it may be. In this picture, I am hammocking while studying for the CPA. Super fun. And then every single Sunday, I volunteer with my Catholic Vietnamese youth group. This is us out at a pumpkin patch during an outdoor event. And then another pandemic hobby I acquired was being a plant daddy. These are a couple of my babies sunbathing on the windowsill right here. And another fun fact about me is that I'm a big foodie right here is me enjoying a Korean dog. Christy Lips and all. Some of my top favorite cuisines would be Mexican and Chinese food. And then another hobby of mine is not not skiing because I've only done it this year for the first time. But I really like trying new things would be another fun fact about me. This is me out in Winter Park, Colorado. Learn how to ski within two days fell a lot, but super fun. Yeah, that's a little bit about me. Thanks everyone. What is a Korean corn dog? So a Korean corn dog, the batter is a little different and then they stuff mozzarella cheese in there. So when you pull it out, it's super, super gooey. It's like a mixture between a mozzarella stick and a corn dog. It's very fun. Yeah, it's very intriguing. I love it. I like to be outdoors. I think that's great. And trying new things is awesome. So hopefully this falls into that category, trying new things. Yeah, forensics. Let's go. Nice. Well, thank you. Who would like to go next? Thank you for next. I'm not going to be. You guys see my PowerPoint? Yep. All right. So my name is Claire and I'm part of the investigation, disputes and compliance practice out of the Washington DC office. I have limited photos due to me being at Lake House right now, but a couple of my hobbies include I'm an avid reader. So the last book I just read was The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah. I love to golf. So I golf usually almost basically every weekend. So the picture at the bottom right is just a bunch of employees that I work with that we partook in the KPMG Make a Wish Foundation golf event last year. And outside of that, I'm also, I love to walk around the National Mall. I recently just moved to the DC office about a year and a half ago. So I'm originally from New Jersey. So going from like a suburban area to more of a city is a very different. So but that's what I do outside of my life of working at KPMG. Nice. You did you said two of my favorite things. So one is I like to read two and the Nightingale is one of my all-time favorite books. It is amazing. I can cry a little bit on that one. Yeah. It was very good and I had never read Kristen Hannah before and it was recommended and I thought oh I know but it was fantastic. Yeah. A lot of our books are sad but they're they're very moving. So yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And now do you have a question? No, I can go next. Oh okay. Yeah. All right. All right. Thanks. Here was screen. Hi everyone. This is Adnan. I'm a specialist operation delivery and managed services. I have been with the farm with nine months. I started as a resident. I just see it. I worked with before I worked with service desk since ESM. Kindly, yeah. I'm with the engagement team. I have some hobbies but the biggest hobby is photography for me. So I like to take pictures whenever I have time. I go out with my friends. I take pictures. I have my cameras with me all the time. So those pictures I took previously with one from Washington DC. This is this one from I guess for California. This far in New York, one took New York and most of them are from New York definitely. Yeah. That's all it told me. Yeah. Okay. Sonny, I can hear you. I guess you got. Yep. I was. Yeah. How long have you been taking photos? Oh, it's almost 10 years. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you've got a lot of experience. It looks like the one with the two people walking in the very bottom looks almost like a postcard or a stack photo or something. Right. That was my friend waiting picture. So he wanted me to take some pictures to get and this one I kind of random quit. And this one for high-porder world, I guess. So it was Universal Studio Hollywood. Nice. So if we have any questions because it sounds like you're a little newer to photography, maybe you guys can share tips. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Great. Thank you, Ed. Nahn. I think I'll next. Okay. Perfect. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Amaya Bessie. So I started at KPMG in September of 2021 as a kid that's hired from Power University. And I'm an associate in the C&L Financial Services Division. So my favorite hobbies are traveling. I travel very often as much as I can. So this picture is actually from last month when I was feeding a monkey coconut in Columbia. This one is from Thailand. I went to an elephant sanctuary and this was ATV riding in Cabo, which I will never do again. And then yeah, this is my dog Ocho. He is my favorite favorite thing, I guess, on the planet. He's 13 and he was just as a shark for Halloween last year. He's so cool. Thank you. And that's a bit about, oh and my favorite hobbies are travelings, when you come to Ocho and beking. Yeah, that's it. Fantastic. So I'm super jealous. What has allowed you to travel so much? Just you plan vacations and go or are you there for studies or kind of how are you going all over the place? All these great places. So I've finished school in May and then I didn't start until September. So I just took that time to travel a lot. And then yeah, for every spring break or like holiday, I usually just go somewhere. I'm a planner. I plan everything in advance. So it gives me time to like, I'll plan out a schedule where I want to go and just kind of incorporate it to my holidays. So yeah, that's what I did. Yeah, that's fantastic. I love it. Now I've got some things to put on my list of things to do. All right. Anybody else want to go? I can see me. Okay. All right, Katie. Thank you. Okay, can you see my screen? Okay, perfect. So hi guys. I'm Katie. I also work with and manage services under operations and delivery with Andon and Sunny. So I am currently working out of Tyson's corner outside of DC. I grew up outside of Philly though. So I go back and forth between the two places pretty frequently. I started in August of 2022 and as you can see, some of my hobbies. I love reading. Me and my roommates have a book club. So those are some of the books that we've been reading. I also love walking and hiking. So in the top, you can see me hiking with some of my friends. And I also love traveling. So I went to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day this year. And I had a blast. I highly recommend. You go if you have the chance. And then my parents just got a golden doodle. So I've been going back home more frequently to CCC. And then I have a picture of DC. But yeah. Nice. I live close enough to Chicago. I could go over weekend and I've never been there on St. Patrick's Day. Oh my gosh. So much fun. What do they, what do they pour in the river like to make a green? Yeah. I think they use like a dye and it's made out of like vegetables or something. Like it's not like it's not harmful for the environment, but it's still really cool. Yeah. It looks pretty cool. The pictures. Yeah. No, for sure. That's what I've heard too. And I think it takes a couple days to dye it. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too. What area did you go up in around Philly? I'm only asking because I did too. Oh, okay. I grew up by Westchester. Oh, okay. I'm like I'll turn a Philly Jersey side. So I grew up in Chilly. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool. It's a small world. Definitely. Yeah. All right. Who's next? I can go next. Oh, you can go if you want. No, I insist. I hate it. All right. Who do we decide? Oh, there we go. Okay. Can everyone see my screen? Yeah. Paul, I broke my phone this weekend and I haven't had the chance to fully restore my phone yet. So a lot of my pictures are kind of like missing for now. That's okay. So I just have like my original KPMG profile picture from when I started the firm two years ago. So I'm Sashant. I'm from Tecris. It's my second year. And a couple of things about me is I love playing sports. I've played basketball and soccer growing up for most of my life. And I love watching them be in that film in particular. The Jets are my team. And like we've been bad for the last like 10 to 12 years. So and this is the first year where we're kind of good. So I'm really excited for this fall. And I love playing video games right free time. And watching TV breaking bad is one of my all time favorite shows. So I have that up here. And like other people in this group I love traveling. I recently gone to Australia, which is super cool. I've got family there. So I had a chance to go to Melbourne and Sydney. I had a chance to see like kangaroos just in the wild. It's really cool. It's kind of like how we have beer. I'm from Jersey. So we look beer everywhere in my neighborhood. And then Australia, I just like kangaroos. And it's just crazy to see them crossing the roads. And just everywhere. But yeah. That's awesome. I'm one I'm curious only because of I have one son who's a gamer as well. And I'm just curious what video games you play. So I play a lot of like games on PS5. I play like FIFA, called duty. So like typical like boy games. And then yeah. I also play like games on my computer like League of Legends and things like that. Okay. So they've played called duty before all of my boys have. But my one who's a big gamer has an aculus right now. Oh no. So yeah. So he's he plays monkey tag a lot. I don't know if anybody is familiar with monkey tag. I've only seen a little snippet of it. I've I've never played it. But we give him grief all the time that hey, you're just sitting there gaming. You should go outside and get some fresh air or like be active. So monkey tag is like super physical. So he'll come down stairs and be like a big sweaty mess because I guess with the aculus sign it's like you know, virtual reality kind of thing. So it's kind of crazy. So I was just curious because I would I'd have some talking points to talk to him about it if you gave me some insight. Well, it's fun. So in college, when my roommate he had an aculus. I always play around with it. And I really play like monkey tag. But you know, you could do like we play like virtual poker. Just be really fun. Because it'd be like a different person throughout like the country. And just like that headset. Yeah. That would be cool. Be cool. All right. Well, thank you Shesant. All right. Tell me how to say it again. Sue Shant. Sue Shant. Okay. Perfect. All right. Andrew, do you want to go next? Oh, yeah. Sure. Just give me one sec. Okay. Bear with me. Sorry. Oh, no problem. I was going to say when Sue Shant was giving his presentation that technology is great until it's not. His phone is broken. It's perfect. And then it breaks. And it's like the world comes to an end almost. Can you see this? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Hi, everyone. My name is Andrew. I'm a strategy associate based in New York. My office is a look at a six avenue by home. I live on from long out so I can do it in. And some fun facts. I take three trains to get here and take between hour 15. I want to have to get to work. I'm in the office today. But anyone happens to be around. Make sure to say hi. I've been at the firm since October. So yeah, seven months, like someone said before. My hobbies, I'm a bassist, but I included picture of me when the accordion. I don't know. I learned it. There's this for me at a concert last year at school. My senior years. So a lot of fun. I play soccer. I play soccer. I play it on my life. I play Thursday nights, I put some friends that every week, but usually I'm a big jazz cat. So if anyone here likes jazz, like let me know. I'll set up a jam session or something. Big proponent of working out. It's good for the mind of body and the travel. Really travel. I'm headed to Maine for more of the weekend with a bunch of friends. We got Airbnb. Should be fun. Hope to go to Europe and use the rest of my PTO before they expire. So that's the plan for September's post project. Just put that out there. And that's me. You're putting it out into the universe, right? So that this engagement ends at that end of August. Exactly. You can take your PTO. Exactly. Sorry, am I going? No worries. I was going to say what position do you play for soccer? I'm a defender. Okay. I've been sitting in Maine since I was three. Oh really? Yeah. Oh no way. You're in New York, I think. Yeah, I'm in New York. Okay, we got to set up something. Yeah. Should be fun. And that's big. All right. Awesome. Thank you. I'll go. All right. Ryan or Andeshe. Who would like to go? I can go. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I should do it like this. Hey, everyone. I'm Ryan. I am at out of the out of your office. And I'm in the GRC SAP practice. I've been with the front for almost a year now. Starting in August of 2022, I was a graduate higher from St. Joseph University. As for hobbies, I enjoyed traveling, particularly national parks, fitness, like going to the gym and playing sports, particularly basketball and now pickleball. I just learned. And while I'm in the affiliate office, like contrary to being in Philadelphia, I'm not a fully sports fan. I'm a Yankees fan and a Boston Celtics fan. Yeah. That's me. What makes you be a New York Yankees fan? I know. I feel like that's very, you know, like I'm a Yankees and a Nix fan. I can't stand a Boston. Boston sports there. Yeah. So I'm originally from North Jersey. So Yankees are just like backyard and Celtics. I'm a little bit Irish. So like, I don't know why I was obsessed with green as a kid. So I've been throwing through a Boston Celtics fan since I can remember. So is it safe to say that you're a Notre Dame fan also then? No, I'm not actually. Yeah. But um, that's just working. Sorry to interrupt. So I'm guessing the Filly upset you had a great way to say that. Yeah. Yeah. The last couple of games had be on the edge of my seat. Yeah. But I'm happy for the outcome. So we'll see. I'm gonna take it all. I left. I left at the halfway. Well, no, like third quarter, I left and got sushi. I was over it. Oh, I can't deal with this. It's hurting my heart. I just like one of the things I wanted to point out real quick. The left photo actually, that's at the top of Angel's Landing and Zion National Park. Supposedly, it's one of like the most treacherous hikes you can do in the US. But it was pretty cool. There was just like chains guiding you. You had to go up rocks like it's very not safe at all. I think they starting to like actually make you sign wave reforms to go up there now. Yeah. But um, yeah. So I can't even ride um, like a ski lift. I got a lot of things ski lift up without losing my mind. So it's probably not for me. It looks fantastic though. That's awesome. Yeah. The view's amazing. Definitely recommend it. Well, perfect. Thank you. Are you ready to share your up? Yeah. Um, sweet. Yeah. Um, hi everyone. Um, this is Andy Shea. Uh, actually, uh, I moved to the US around six and a half years ago. And I got to start it here. My PhD in mechanical engineering. And after five years, I graduated in mechanical engineering and, um, do some data analysis and data scientists. And I got started in KPMG on February 2021. Um, sorry, 2022. Sorry, it's something is wrong. Yeah. And also about my hobby, I love, um, reading, hiking and also I enjoy swimming swimming. And I do a lot of traveling around the US. And also, um, my office location is in Los Angeles. California. And also I'm working at Wiser department. And I'm really happy to be as a member in your in in this team. Yes. All right. So we've got a few readers in the group. We've got a lot of active people for sure. I think hiking, walking or being outside was mentioned or some type of sport was mentioned by everybody. So that's awesome. I feel like we have some uncovered, um, the similarities. Soccer is one of them. You know, several of you guys are from the same area. So that's awesome. I I'm happy that we had an opportunity to do this because it just gives me a little insight into you guys and, and all of you can kind of get the same insight on who you're going to be working with. So I know the work is not necessarily one on one with each other, but, um, just to collaborate shared, you know, ideas, things you've come across, that type of thing. So I think that's awesome. Let's see. I think the other thing on the agenda was, um, just to talk about how we are going to work together. So this is really just open dialogue between all of us. I wanted to get us kicked off with a team pod call, but I don't really have any type of set format that I am super strict about operating in. So I think it's probably going to necessitate. I think the work is probably going to necessitate us meeting. At a bare minimum weekly, I've heard daily thrown out there by other people. So I don't, I don't know yet what that's going to look like. Just because I don't think any of us really know exactly what the work is yet. So we can kind of play that by ear. I definitely want to make sure that we're connecting so that, you know, we can talk about what you're experiencing, make sure, ask questions, stay connected on what's happening. Sometimes Katie might have a question and Ryan's already done it and he's like, oh yeah, I did this that and the other and so just sharing those types of experiences and insights too. And as far as one on one's go, my feeling is we can do them as much or as little as you guys want them at this point. I'm not sure if we're going to meet, you know, I'm not sure exactly. I don't know if we're going to have a whole lot of one on one stuff to discuss. I think it's really going to be more team stuff to discuss. Because you guys know, I'm not your PML so we're not talking about anything like that. It would really just be engagement type of, well, let me rephrase. I'm happy to talk about whatever you guys want. But, you know, it's a different relationship. So there may not be a lot for us to talk about one on one, but I'm just throwing it out there for you guys to think about if you like to connect or feel that you want that or need that. I'm more than happy to do it on an individual basis outside of team calls too. I did want to ask, I set up the team's chat because I saw, oh, this will be a great way for us, all to stay connected. And then I realized that sometimes if you're in the chat and it's pinging, that might be distracting for some people. So I just wanted to let you know, I still like the team chat idea. But if you find it's distracting, if somebody's, if we're having a conversation and it's not pertaining to you or you don't have that question, you can feel free to mute it if you want or, you know, however you want to work is totally fine. If I have anything like that requires, I don't know, some type of response right away. I'll probably email it just to make sure everyone gets the same information and sees it. So I just wanted to let you guys know that too. I did want to ask, like, is there any preferences anybody has or any suggestions on, hey, this worked well for a team I was on before or you have really like this type of communication or, you know, anything like that because we're kind of building our team right now. And I really just want to set up things that's going to work well for them, you know, for the most part. Obviously, if it works for one person, it doesn't work for the other, we might not be able to roll it out to everybody, but just kind of throw it out there for any type of thoughts you guys might have. The only thing I would have to say is that it's kind of hard to see what kind of communication we want because of the lack of knowing what kind of work we're doing on a daily basis. I think I'm more open for like a trial and error type of deal. So, you know, whether that's a team's call or a one-on-one call with you, Sunny or, yeah, just doing a chat type of deal. So, yeah, I agree. Also, depending on like the work itself, maybe like having a team like Action Item Shocker, like that might be helpful. I don't really know what the work consists of, but possibly that could be helpful. Yeah, yep, I like that idea a lot. And I don't mind playing it by ear. I think you're right, Claire. There's not a whole lot of, I guess, definition around exactly what is going to happen today. So, I suppose if there's a whole bunch of requirements that teams have to meet every day, then we might have to touch point every day and say, hey, okay, where is everybody at this? Or if there's a lot of Action items and follow-up items type of thing. So, totally comfortable with that. We can just see how the next few weeks go. Hopefully, we'll have more information this week or next on what that all is about exactly the work. So, I think there's also going to be some CNB specific training coming our way. I just don't know yet if it's trained the team leads and the team leads train you guys, or if it's a train, the trainer, somebody else comes in and trains. I'm not sure how they're going to roll it out yet. So, we'll let's have to see on that one. All right, well, obviously keep thinking on that too. And, you know, you're always welcome to let me know if something pops up. Just the last thing that I had was if there were any questions from you guys. I've, for those of you that I've had an opportunity to do a one-on-one call with just to meet, I've asked this question too, and you've given me some of them. I've jotted them down. But, if you have any questions that are kind of floating around that you want answers to, let me know. I'll jade them down. If I probably won't know the answer at this point, but I can escalate it up and see if we can get some answers. And if not now, that's fine. If you think of something, just email it or chat, you know, and I'll add it to the list. All right. Well, I guess that's it. I just really wanted a chance to kind of put some faces with names and chat a little bit. So we'll just figure out all of this together and go down this new adventure at KPMG. And hopefully it doesn't suck, right? Okay, that's it. All right, guys. Hopefully. Hopefully, right. All right, well, let me know if you need anything for me. If you have any questions, otherwise, I won't schedule any other team calls until we get an idea of kind of what the structure is going to be. Gotcha. All right. I'll talk to you later. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Seen not healthy. lit.
