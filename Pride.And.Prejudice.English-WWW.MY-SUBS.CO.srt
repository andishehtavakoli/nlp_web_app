1
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,873
Lydia! Kitty!

2
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,159
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

3
00:02:55,334 --> 00:03:00,042
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

4
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:06,258
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

5
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,142
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

6
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,141
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

7
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:21,565
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

8
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,359
- He's single!
- Who's single?

9
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,239
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

10
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,280
How can that possibly affect them?

11
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,615
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?

12
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,158
You know he must marry one of them.

13
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,369
That is his design in settling here?

14
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,788
You must go and visit him at once.

15
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,919
Good heavens. People.

16
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:47,462
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

17
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:51,847
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

18
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,553
There's no need. I already have.

19
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,184
- You have?
- When?

20
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,937
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

21
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,521
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

22
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:07,318
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

23
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,781
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

24
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,947
Papa!

25
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,405
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

26
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,951
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

27
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:19,331
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

28
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,876
Who's got warts?

29
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:24,294
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

30
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:28,718
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

31
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,802
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

32
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,809
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

33
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,725
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

34
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,647
Two weeks I'll do it for.

35
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:24,229
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

36
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,283
I can't breathe.

37
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,827
I think one of
my toes just came off.

38
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,967
If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

39
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,928
then I'm no judge of beauty.

40
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,139
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

41
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,850
They're not all bad.

42
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,889
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

43
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,352
One day,
someone will catch your eye,

44
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,938
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

45
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,417
How good of you to come.

46
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,260
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

47
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,178
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

48
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:41,388
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

49
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,979
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

50
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,143
Tell me.

51
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:50,109
10,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

52
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,316
The miserable half.

53
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:24,599
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him
to the girls immediately.

54
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,312
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

55
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:44,868
Mary.

56
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,999
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

57
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:53,588
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

58
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:57,505
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

59
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

60
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:05,554
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

61
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,411
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

62
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,581
Very much.

63
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,085
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

64
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:37,715
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

65
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,464
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

66
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,095
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

67
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:48,014
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

68
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,475
That's exactly what I meant.

69
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:57,523
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

70
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,317
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

71
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,863
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

72
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,285
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

73
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:08,993
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

74
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:19,378
Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

75
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,045
Mr Bennet.

76
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:39,314
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

77
00:09:58,215 --> 00:10:01,299
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

78
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,180
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?

79
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,555
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

80
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:12,224
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

81
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:15,396
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

82
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:19,943
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

83
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:24,406
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

84
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:27,030
You're wasting your time with me.

85
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:35,541
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

86
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:36,997
Precisely.

87
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:39,917
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

88
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,462
let alone the miserable half.

89
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,572
Wait!

90
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:09,011
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

91
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,468
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

92
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,517
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?

93
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,642
She is indeed.

94
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,854
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

95
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,732
Oh, yes, I adore her.

96
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:27,065
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

97
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:30,738
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

98
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:35,156
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

99
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,326
Mama, please!

100
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,624
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

101
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,999
I was sure he would make her an offer.

102
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,753
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

103
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,169
And that put paid to it.

104
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:50,758
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

105
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,304
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

106
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,974
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

107
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,187
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

108
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,152
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

109
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:34,093
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

110
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:37,763
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

111
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,770
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

112
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:43,144
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

113
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:47,983
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

114
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:51,652
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

115
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,824
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

116
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,285
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

117
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,412
All the world
is good in your eyes.

118
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:03,874
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

119
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,458
Mr Darcy?

120
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,422
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

121
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,380
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

122
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,042
He danced with Miss Lucas.

123
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,087
We were all there, dear.

124
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,380
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

125
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,302
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

126
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,140
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

127
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,429
and the fifth again with Jane.

128
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,892
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

129
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:05,225
The way you carry on,

130
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,481
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

131
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,939
When you die,
which may be very soon,

132
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:15,654
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

133
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:19,407
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

134
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:23,077
From Netherfield Hall.

135
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,955
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

136
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:32,127
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

137
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,171
It is from Caroline Bingley.

138
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:41,095
She has invited me to dine with her.

139
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,350
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

140
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,477
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

141
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:50,353
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

142
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,441
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

143
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:58,154
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

144
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:01,198
Horseback!

145
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:18,384
Lizzie.

146
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,929
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

147
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:25,265
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

148
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:27,309
are positively occult.

149
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:32,105
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

150
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:40,488
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

151
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:44,739
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

152
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:50,120
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

153
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,624
People do not die of colds.

154
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:56,212
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

155
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,094
I must go to Netherfield at once.

156
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:18,233
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

157
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:21,613
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

158
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,078
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

159
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:43,009
Good Lord, did you walk here?

160
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,222
I did.

161
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:56,602
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

162
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,778
Thank you.

163
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,166
My goodness, did you
see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

164
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:17,502
She looked positively mediaeval.

165
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:22,216
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

166
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:27,972
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

167
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:35,601
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

168
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,104
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

169
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:39,984
It's a pleasure.

170
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:44,027
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

171
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:48,073
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

172
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,537
Not going to be famous, our pig.

173
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:57,042
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

174
00:18:57,254 --> 00:19:00,338
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

175
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,841
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

176
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,259
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

177
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,760
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

178
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,180
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

179
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,350
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

180
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,599
Wait for me!

181
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:20,192
You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

182
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:28,905
Officers!

183
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:04,526
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

184
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,777
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

185
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,573
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

186
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,615
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

187
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,659
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

188
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,371
Tell your sister I long to see her.

189
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,920
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

190
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,340
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

191
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,760
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

192
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,053
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

193
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,101
You young ladies are so accomplished.

194
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,768
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

195
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,350
and embroider cushions.

196
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:43,690
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

197
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:46,108
The word is applied too liberally.

198
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,444
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

199
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,402
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

200
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,743
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

201
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,538
- I do.
- Absolutely.

202
00:20:56,748 --> 00:21:00,413
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

203
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:03,919
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

204
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:07,963
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

205
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:11,047
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

206
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:14,970
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

207
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,475
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

208
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:23,148
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

209
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:29,068
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

210
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:51,007
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

211
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:54,470
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

212
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,846
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

213
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,558
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

214
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,810
What can he mean?

215
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:06,231
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

216
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:09,195
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

217
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:13,570
Either you are
in each other's confidence

218
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:15,865
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

219
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:18,284
or you are conscious
that your figures

220
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:21,663
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

221
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,913
If the first,
I should get in your way.

222
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:29,005
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

223
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:31,546
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

224
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:35,763
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

225
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:40,640
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

226
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:43,812
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

227
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,107
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

228
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,067
or their offences against me.

229
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:52,777
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

230
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,908
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

231
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:00,201
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

232
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,620
A family trait, I think.

233
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:36,615
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

234
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,784
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

235
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:45,831
What an excellent room you have, sir.

236
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:49,666
Such expensive furnishings.

237
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:52,839
I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

238
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,842
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

239
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,721
I find it perfectly adequate.

240
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,802
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

241
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,850
Less varied? Not at all.

242
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:09,106
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

243
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:13,735
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

244
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:17,694
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

245
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:21,573
Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?

246
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,287
A ball?

247
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:28,164
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

248
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,334
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

249
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,375
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

250
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:38,091
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

251
00:24:38,303 --> 00:24:42,431
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

252
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,727
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

253
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,520
Thank you, Mary.

254
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:53,900
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?

255
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:57,402
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

256
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:59,322
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

257
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:02,326
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

258
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:05,329
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

259
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:08,664
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

260
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:12,416
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

261
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,047
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

262
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:34,437
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

263
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,361
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

264
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,945
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

265
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,324
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

266
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,371
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

267
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:54,336
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

268
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:56,960
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

269
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:00,009
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

270
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:01,172
When?

271
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:04,387
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

272
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,848
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

273
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:15,479
Mr Collins, at your service.

274
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:28,782
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

275
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:33,953
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

276
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:38,421
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

277
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,087
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

278
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,217
Excellent.

279
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:46,802
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

280
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:53,768
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

281
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,560
You've heard of her, I presume?

282
00:26:56,733 --> 00:27:00,731
My small rectory abuts her estate,

283
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:03,573
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

284
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,576
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

285
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:11,371
Does she have any family?

286
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:16,042
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

287
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,376
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

288
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:21,631
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

289
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:27,595
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

290
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:31,555
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

291
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:36,062
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

292
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:38,769
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

293
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:42,525
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

294
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:48,114
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

295
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,740
or are they
the result of previous study?

296
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:53,492
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

297
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:58,084
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

298
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:01,878
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

299
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,170
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

300
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:16,392
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

301
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:19,564
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

302
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:24,194
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

303
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:28,782
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?</i>

304
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:38,705
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

305
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:41,333
a parsonage of no mean size.

306
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,628
I have become aware of the fact.

307
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,755
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

308
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:51,344
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

309
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:55,347
has captured my special attention.

310
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,265
Oh, Mr Collins.

311
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:02,566
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

312
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:08,986
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

313
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:10,486
Engaged.

314
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:13,114
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

315
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:16,744
would make anyone an excellent partner.

316
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:20,960
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

317
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:25,505
Indeed. Indeed.

318
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:28,171
A very agreeable alternative.

319
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:53,781
Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

320
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:58,246
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

321
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:01,623
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

322
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:03,252
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

323
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,255
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

324
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:09,507
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

325
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:12,256
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?

326
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,806
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

327
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,513
I shan't even browse.

328
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,439
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

329
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:26,145
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

330
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:27,777
No, it's true.

331
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:31,111
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

332
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:34,697
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

333
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,994
What do your superiors do with you?

334
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:43,667
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

335
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:48,003
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

336
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:52,465
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

337
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:00,222
I insist.

338
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:06,481
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

339
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,319
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

340
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,692
I was just on my way to your house.

341
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,989
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

342
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,616
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

343
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:20,412
Oh, Lydia.

344
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:24,205
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

345
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:27,709
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

346
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:30,503
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

347
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:35,135
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

348
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:41,056
Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

349
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:46,766
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

350
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,814
About a month.

351
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:54,524
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

352
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:58,992
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

353
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:04,078
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

354
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:10,376
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

355
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:14,592
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

356
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,718
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not I.

357
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:24,558
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

358
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:30,939
My father managed his estate.

359
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:34,318
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

360
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:40,491
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

361
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:43,158
We were both with him the day he died.

362
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,039
With his last breath,

363
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:50,375
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

364
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:54,170
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

365
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,674
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

366
00:32:57,886 --> 00:33:00,673
- But why?
- Jealousy.

367
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:05,304
His father...

368
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:08,561
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

369
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:12,317
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

370
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:16,233
Too lowly even to be noticed.

371
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:32,252
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

372
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,670
Betsy.

373
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,426
Betsy!

374
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:55,103
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

375
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:58,860
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

376
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,364
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

377
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:04,865
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

378
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:07,325
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

379
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:09,786
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

380
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,123
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

381
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:16,042
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

382
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:23,094
There they are, look.

383
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:26,430
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

384
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:34,145
Jane Martin is here.

385
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,593
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

386
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:07,845
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

387
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:09,054
Charming.

388
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:13,811
I'm so pleased you're here.

389
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,187
So am I.

390
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,358
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

391
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:26,032
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

392
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:29,950
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

393
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:42,588
You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

394
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:46,508
I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

395
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:49,177
Did you see how he dotes on her?

396
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:54,058
Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

397
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,537
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

398
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:18,499
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

399
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:35,059
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

400
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,520
Detained where? He must be here.

401
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:42,943
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

402
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:46,611
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

403
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:50,903
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

404
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:55,621
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

405
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:59,207
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

406
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:03,043
on my lightness of foot.

407
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:32,406
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

408
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:39,792
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

409
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,543
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

410
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:51,886
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

411
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:57,138
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

412
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:59,559
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

413
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:01,811
Which is my primary object.

414
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:04,811
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

415
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:07,902
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

416
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:10,609
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

417
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:27,460
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

418
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:29,548
You may.

419
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:43,814
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

420
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:49,024
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

421
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:07,834
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

422
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:14,424
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

423
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,390
I talked about the dance.

424
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:22,433
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

425
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:26,684
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

426
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:29,147
That reply will do for present.

427
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,529
Perhaps by and by I may observe

428
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,908
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

429
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,664
For now, we may remain silent.

430
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:54,467
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

431
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:58,510
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

432
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,935
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

433
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:12,231
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

434
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:18,364
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

435
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:21,489
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

436
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:27,288
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

437
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:33,382
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

438
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,302
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

439
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:42,223
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

440
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:46,562
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

441
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,185
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

442
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:52,940
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

443
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:56,859
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

444
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:46,407
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

445
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:48,373
I must make myself known to him.

446
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,459
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

447
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:54,582
He will consider it an impertinence.

448
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:57,294
Mr Darcy.

449
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:59,590
Mr Darcy.

450
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,471
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

451
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:08,601
What interesting relatives you have.

452
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:29,828
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

453
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,375
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

454
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:39,086
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

455
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:40,967
I have a beautiful grey.

456
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:45,010
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than I, of course.

457
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:53,354
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

458
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:58,652
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

459
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:25,842
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

460
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:29,970
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

461
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:33,643
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

462
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:37,942
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

463
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,482
Bingley likes her enormously,

464
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:43,400
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

465
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:47,322
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

466
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:49,950
We are all fools in love.

467
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:53,123
He does not know
her character as we do.

468
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,705
She should move fast
and snap him up.

469
00:43:55,877 --> 00:43:59,293
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

470
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,422
I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

471
00:44:04,594 --> 00:44:06,552
and make us chase it.

472
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,020
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

473
00:44:17,232 --> 00:44:21,146
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

474
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:42,920
Emily, please!

475
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:48,803
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

476
00:44:48,972 --> 00:44:52,139
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

477
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,723
I hate balls.

478
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:15,994
Mr Bennet, wake up.

479
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:20,875
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

480
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:25,629
Charles, you cannot be serious.

481
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:38,229
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

482
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,560
Mr Bennet!

483
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:50,986
Mary, please.

484
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:01,373
Thank you, Mr Hill.

485
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:22,147
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

486
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:26,984
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

487
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:32,866
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

488
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:37,412
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

489
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:42,000
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

490
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,125
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

491
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:47,840
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

492
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,380
Now.

493
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:56,179
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

494
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:01,936
Papa, stay.

495
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,090
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

496
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,883
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

497
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,468
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

498
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:41,806
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

499
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,690
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

500
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:47,608
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

501
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:50,232
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

502
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:53,073
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

503
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,238
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

504
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:00,328
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

505
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:04,080
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

506
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:06,623
that I select a wife.

507
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:09,921
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

508
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,129
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

509
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,218
for I am to inherit the estate

510
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:18,554
and such an alliance will surely...

511
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,640
...suit everyone.

512
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:28,355
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

513
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:31,063
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

514
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:33,401
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

515
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:38,240
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

516
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,993
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

517
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:47,289
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

518
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:52,170
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

519
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:57,256
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

520
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:01,136
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

521
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:04,973
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

522
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:09,730
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

523
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,735
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

524
00:49:12,903 --> 00:49:17,197
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

525
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:20,990
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

526
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:25,580
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

527
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:29,332
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

528
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:32,041
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

529
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:42,471
Headstrong, foolish child.

530
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,360
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

531
00:49:57,489 --> 00:50:00,988
Lizzie. Lizzie!

532
00:50:05,122 --> 00:50:09,416
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

533
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:13,291
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

534
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:15,919
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

535
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:19,715
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

536
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:22,722
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

537
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:27,516
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

538
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:28,848
Now!

539
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:44,617
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

540
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:48,866
You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

541
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,995
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

542
00:50:52,169 --> 00:50:54,707
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

543
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,418
Mr Bennet, say something.

544
00:51:01,345 --> 00:51:04,678
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

545
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,595
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

546
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:11,765
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

547
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:14,394
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

548
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:18,440
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

549
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:21,779
and I will never see you again
if you do.

550
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:23,573
Thank you, Papa.

551
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:31,955
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

552
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,836
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

553
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:38,589
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

554
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:41,758
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

555
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,676
Jane!

556
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:51,102
What's the matter? Jane?

557
00:52:45,615 --> 00:52:49,031
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

558
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:51,491
Why does he not know when he'll return?

559
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:52,826
Read it.

560
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,717
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

561
00:53:06,928 --> 00:53:09,846
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

562
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,929
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

563
00:53:14,102 --> 00:53:16,807
Is that not clear enough?

564
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,685
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

565
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:22,527
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

566
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:27,652
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

567
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:32,493
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

568
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:36,746
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

569
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:40,541
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

570
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:54,765
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

571
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,390
Poor Jane.

572
00:53:57,604 --> 00:54:01,981
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

573
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,190
It gives her something to think of

574
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:07,528
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

575
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:11,571
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

576
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,659
You've turned down Collins.

577
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:18,123
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

578
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,165
What about Mr Wickham?

579
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:23,122
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

580
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:26,962
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

581
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:30,758
who would make the most of it.

582
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:52,321
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

583
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:58,039
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

584
00:54:58,206 --> 00:55:00,495
- Engaged?
- Yes.

585
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:10,006
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

586
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:14,802
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

587
00:55:14,973 --> 00:55:17,974
I should be
as happy with him as any other.

588
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:20,972
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

589
00:55:21,146 --> 00:55:24,895
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

590
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:28,899
I've been offered
a comfortable home and protection.

591
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:30,779
There's a lot to be thankful for.

592
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:36,410
I'm 27 years old.
I've no money and no prospects.

593
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:40,161
I'm already a burden to my parents.

594
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:42,787
And I'm frightened.

595
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:47,503
So dont judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

596
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:42,852
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

597
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:47,354
<i>I'm glad the house,
furniture and roads are to your taste,</i>

598
00:56:47,524 --> 00:56:50,940
<i>and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.</i>

599
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:53,780
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

600
00:56:53,947 --> 00:56:57,446
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

601
00:56:57,617 --> 00:57:01,532
<i>I must confess, the view
from where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

602
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:04,701
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

603
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:09,003
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

604
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:17,758
Welcome to our humble abode.

605
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:26,850
My wife encourages me to spend time
in the garden for my health.

606
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:29,394
I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

607
00:57:29,608 --> 00:57:34,234
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

608
00:57:34,404 --> 00:57:37,358
I flatter myself
that any young lady would be happy

609
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:40,533
to be the mistress of such a house.

610
00:57:41,703 --> 00:57:43,577
We shan't be disturbed here.

611
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:47,621
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

612
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:54,459
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

613
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:57,634
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

614
00:57:57,803 --> 00:58:01,800
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

615
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:04,511
Come and see, Lizzie.

616
00:58:04,685 --> 00:58:07,306
Great news.

617
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:10,729
We received an invitation to Rosings
from Lady Catherine.

618
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:12,441
How wonderful!

619
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:15,610
Do not make yourself uneasy
about your apparel.

620
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:18,109
Just put on the best you've brought.

621
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:22,825
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

622
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,119
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

623
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:30,832
The glazing alone
costs upwards of 20,000.

624
00:58:31,044 --> 00:58:33,582
Come along. Come along.

625
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:45,306
A little later we'll play cards.

626
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:49,138
Your Ladyship.

627
00:58:49,312 --> 00:58:52,313
Miss de Bourgh.

628
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:14,208
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

629
00:59:17,883 --> 00:59:20,338
This is my daughter.

630
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:27,014
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of 300.

631
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,933
Mr Darcy.

632
00:59:32,356 --> 00:59:34,395
What are you doing here?

633
00:59:36,526 --> 00:59:40,026
Mr Darcy,
I had no idea we had the honour.

634
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:46,907
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

635
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,996
I had the pleasure
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

636
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,914
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

637
01:00:00,467 --> 01:00:06,470
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move. Over there.

638
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:26,530
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me the fish course...

639
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:30,782
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

640
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:32,913
They are, thank you.

641
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,629
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

642
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,797
I haven't been fortunate enough...

643
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:46,386
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

644
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:51,015
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

645
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:54,433
No, not at all.

646
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:56,853
Your sisters, do they draw?

647
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:58,352
Not one.

648
01:00:58,525 --> 01:01:00,019
That's very strange.

649
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:02,815
I suppose you had no opportunity.

650
01:01:02,988 --> 01:01:06,902
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

651
01:01:07,075 --> 01:01:11,203
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

652
01:01:11,371 --> 01:01:14,787
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

653
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:20,456
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

654
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:24,759
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

655
01:01:24,926 --> 01:01:26,966
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

656
01:01:31,808 --> 01:01:34,264
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

657
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:36,601
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

658
01:01:36,772 --> 01:01:39,773
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

659
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:43,690
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

660
01:01:44,446 --> 01:01:47,363
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

661
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:49,240
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

662
01:01:50,118 --> 01:01:52,325
But it would be hard on younger sisters

663
01:01:52,496 --> 01:01:56,161
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

664
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,334
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

665
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:04,461
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

666
01:02:04,675 --> 01:02:07,344
Pray, what is your age?

667
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:11,425
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

668
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,689
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

669
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:28,194
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

670
01:02:28,365 --> 01:02:30,654
In fact,
there are few people in England

671
01:02:30,826 --> 01:02:34,740
who have more true enjoyment of music.

672
01:02:34,913 --> 01:02:36,491
Or better natural taste.

673
01:02:37,457 --> 01:02:43,044
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

674
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:47,377
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

675
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,762
I'm not afflicted with false
modesty, when I say I play poorly...

676
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,679
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

677
01:03:17,622 --> 01:03:20,789
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

678
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,417
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

679
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:27,838
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

680
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,463
I've told Mrs Collins this.

681
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:34,093
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

682
01:03:34,264 --> 01:03:37,265
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

683
01:03:37,476 --> 01:03:41,308
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

684
01:03:48,528 --> 01:03:53,653
You mean to frighten me
by coming in all your state to hear me.

685
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:57,740
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

686
01:03:57,913 --> 01:04:01,827
I know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

687
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:05,956
What was my friend like
in Hertfordshire?

688
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:09,172
You really care to know?

689
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:12,549
Prepare yourself
for something very dreadful.

690
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:15,762
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

691
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:17,555
though gentlemen were scarce

692
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:20,518
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

693
01:04:20,686 --> 01:04:24,434
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

694
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:27,353
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

695
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:40,700
I do not have the talent

696
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:44,248
of conversing easily
with people I have never met before.

697
01:04:44,668 --> 01:04:48,333
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

698
01:05:09,317 --> 01:05:12,188
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

699
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:25,536
Mr Darcy.

700
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:34,919
Please, do be seated.

701
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,346
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

702
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:53,192
This is a charming house.

703
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:57,739
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

704
01:05:57,908 --> 01:06:00,280
I believe so.

705
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:06,703
She could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful subject.

706
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:18,467
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

707
01:06:22,516 --> 01:06:25,303
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

708
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:35,316
What on earth have you done
to poor Mr Darcy?

709
01:06:35,487 --> 01:06:37,859
I have no idea.

710
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:41,779
Every mind must have some counsellor

711
01:06:41,952 --> 01:06:45,617
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

712
01:06:45,789 --> 01:06:50,581
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

713
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:52,626
I have in view those objects

714
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:55,922
which are only
to be obtained through intercourse...

715
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:03,509
Forgive me, through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

716
01:07:03,724 --> 01:07:09,477
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

717
01:07:09,688 --> 01:07:14,480
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

718
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:18,276
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

719
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:21,697
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

720
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:25,615
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

721
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:29,578
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

722
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:32,876
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

723
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:36,502
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

724
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:38,084
What happened?

725
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:40,381
He saved him
from an imprudent marriage.

726
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:41,756
Who's the man?

727
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:51,099
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

728
01:07:53,482 --> 01:07:56,436
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

729
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:59,776
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

730
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:03,238
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

731
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:07,661
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

732
01:08:09,206 --> 01:08:13,915
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

733
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:45,824
Miss Elizabeth.

734
01:08:45,993 --> 01:08:48,614
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

735
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:52,951
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

736
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:56,291
I have fought against
judgement, my family's expectation,

737
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:59,338
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank.

738
01:08:59,506 --> 01:09:02,127
I will put them aside
and ask you to end my agony.

739
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,467
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

740
01:09:07,597 --> 01:09:09,970
Most ardently.

741
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:17,141
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

742
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:22,481
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

743
01:09:22,696 --> 01:09:25,234
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

744
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:27,488
It was unconsciously done.

745
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,702
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

746
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:33,576
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

747
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:34,911
Are you rejecting me?

748
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:40,665
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

749
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:44,006
Might I ask why with so little civility
I am thus repulsed?

750
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:49,425
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

751
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:51,887
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

752
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:55,059
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

753
01:09:55,228 --> 01:09:58,811
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

754
01:09:58,982 --> 01:10:02,149
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

755
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:07,028
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

756
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,571
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

757
01:10:09,743 --> 01:10:12,578
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

758
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:14,785
involving them both in acute misery?

759
01:10:14,998 --> 01:10:18,414
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

760
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:21,456
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

761
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,299
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

762
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:25,462
She's shy!

763
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:28,297
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

764
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,510
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

765
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:33,516
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

766
01:10:37,729 --> 01:10:40,267
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

767
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:43,020
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

768
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:45,233
- It was suggested...
- What was?

769
01:10:45,404 --> 01:10:47,859
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

770
01:10:48,031 --> 01:10:50,403
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

771
01:10:50,617 --> 01:10:54,697
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

772
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:57,327
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

773
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:02,416
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

774
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:10,799
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

775
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:17,100
And what about Mr Wickham?

776
01:11:19,354 --> 01:11:20,350
Mr Wickham?

777
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:23,315
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

778
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:26,733
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

779
01:11:26,903 --> 01:11:29,573
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

780
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,946
yet treat him with sarcasm.

781
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:34,157
So this is your opinion of me?

782
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:37,785
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

783
01:11:37,956 --> 01:11:42,250
had not your pride been hurt
by my scruples about our relationship.

784
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:45,627
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

785
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:48,467
And those are the words of a gentleman.

786
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:53,342
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

787
01:11:53,513 --> 01:11:59,267
made me realise you were the last man
in the world I could ever marry.

788
01:12:10,656 --> 01:12:15,531
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

789
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:21,741
I came to leave you this.

790
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:35,962
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

791
01:14:36,176 --> 01:14:40,423
But if I may, I will address the
two offences you have laid against me.

792
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,354
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

793
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:54,314
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

794
01:14:54,486 --> 01:14:59,113
<i>Mr Wickham announced
he had no intention of taking orders.</i>

795
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:05,078
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

796
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,582
<i>He then wrote,
demanding more money, which I refused.</i>

797
01:15:10,752 --> 01:15:13,837
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

798
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:18,425
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

799
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:22,508
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

800
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:26,346
<i>She is to inherit 30,000.</i>

801
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:31,939
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

802
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:35,772
<i>I will not attempt to convey the depth
of Georgiana's despair.</i>

803
01:15:35,986 --> 01:15:39,070
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

804
01:15:41,033 --> 01:15:44,698
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

805
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:48,411
<i>though the motives which governed me
may appear insufficient,</i>

806
01:15:48,623 --> 01:15:51,957
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

807
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:54,167
Lizzie.

808
01:15:57,382 --> 01:15:59,256
Are you all right?

809
01:15:59,468 --> 01:16:02,801
I hardly know.

810
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:13,897
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

811
01:16:14,107 --> 01:16:17,772
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

812
01:16:17,944 --> 01:16:21,278
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

813
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:29,994
I'm quite over him. If he passed me
in the street, I'd hardly notice.

814
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:34,039
London is so diverting. It's true.

815
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:38,507
There's so much to entertain.

816
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:46,178
What news from Kent?

817
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:50,057
Nothing.

818
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:53,935
At least not much to entertain.

819
01:16:54,106 --> 01:16:55,897
Lizzie, tell Mama!

820
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,777
Stop making such a fuss.

821
01:16:58,944 --> 01:17:02,776
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

822
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,527
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

823
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:07,907
Let's all go.

824
01:17:08,078 --> 01:17:11,032
Lydia's been invited to Brighton
with the Forsters.

825
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:13,246
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

826
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,705
I shall dine with the officers
every night.

827
01:17:15,877 --> 01:17:17,835
Papa, don't let her go.

828
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:22,755
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

829
01:17:22,926 --> 01:17:27,469
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

830
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,720
If you do not check her,

831
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:34,642
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

832
01:17:34,855 --> 01:17:36,646
And Kitty will follow, as always.

833
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:41,732
Lizzie, we shall have no peace
until she goes.

834
01:17:41,903 --> 01:17:45,237
Is that really all you care about?

835
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:48,990
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

836
01:17:49,202 --> 01:17:51,990
He will keep her
out of any real mischief.

837
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:54,999
And she's too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

838
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:56,329
It's dangerous.

839
01:17:56,543 --> 01:18:01,086
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

840
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:06,006
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

841
01:18:06,219 --> 01:18:11,012
will teach her her own insignificance.

842
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:13,846
At any rate,
she can hardly grow any worse.

843
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:18,562
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

844
01:18:27,824 --> 01:18:30,446
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

845
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:32,576
The Peak District is not Brighton.

846
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:36,287
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

847
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,580
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

848
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:44,337
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

849
01:18:44,549 --> 01:18:47,716
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

850
01:18:47,886 --> 01:18:51,220
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

851
01:18:51,431 --> 01:18:54,681
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

852
01:19:01,692 --> 01:19:05,938
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

853
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:07,690
Why did you not tell me?

854
01:19:10,325 --> 01:19:12,781
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

855
01:19:14,913 --> 01:19:16,324
No.

856
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:23,124
No, he did not.

857
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,359
Oh, what are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

858
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:34,030
Or carriages that work?

859
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:40,451
Where exactly are we?

860
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:43,038
Quite close to Pemberley.

861
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:47,250
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

862
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:51,087
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

863
01:20:51,259 --> 01:20:52,339
Oh, no, let's not.

864
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:58,095
Well, he's so...

865
01:20:58,308 --> 01:21:01,891
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

866
01:21:02,062 --> 01:21:03,770
- So what?
- So rich.

867
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:07,105
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

868
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:11,024
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

869
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:16,659
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

870
01:22:20,974 --> 01:22:22,349
Keep up.

871
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:46,536
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

872
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,206
He dearly loves it here.

873
01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:53,126
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

874
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:04,552
He's a lot like his father.

875
01:23:09,022 --> 01:23:13,483
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

876
01:23:17,823 --> 01:23:21,903
He just organised the servants for me.

877
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:40,382
This is he, Mr Darcy.

878
01:23:41,638 --> 01:23:43,761
A handsome face.

879
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:48,181
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

880
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:51,811
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

881
01:23:51,982 --> 01:23:54,271
Only a little.

882
01:23:54,484 --> 01:23:58,564
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

883
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:00,149
Yes.

884
01:24:02,743 --> 01:24:04,949
Yes, I dare say he is.

885
01:24:08,498 --> 01:24:11,416
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

886
01:24:11,877 --> 01:24:15,542
She sings and plays all day long.

887
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:20,255
Is she at home?

888
01:26:26,053 --> 01:26:27,511
Miss Elizabeth.

889
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:43,400
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

890
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,859
No, I'm not.

891
01:26:46,031 --> 01:26:47,739
No.

892
01:26:47,908 --> 01:26:51,241
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

893
01:26:57,042 --> 01:26:58,453
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

894
01:27:01,171 --> 01:27:03,211
And are you having a pleasant trip?

895
01:27:03,382 --> 01:27:06,003
Very pleasant.

896
01:27:06,176 --> 01:27:09,675
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

897
01:27:11,556 --> 01:27:14,723
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

898
01:27:14,935 --> 01:27:16,974
Yes.

899
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:22,357
I'm so sorry to intrude.

900
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:26,612
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

901
01:27:30,617 --> 01:27:32,989
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

902
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:39,037
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

903
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:42,794
Yes, I know.

904
01:27:47,634 --> 01:27:50,006
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

905
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:10,193
This way, sir.

906
01:28:16,204 --> 01:28:18,327
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

907
01:28:31,428 --> 01:28:34,927
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

908
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:39,766
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

909
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,474
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

910
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:44,018
To dine with him?

911
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:48,568
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

912
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:51,654
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

913
01:28:51,823 --> 01:28:55,406
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

914
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:57,285
His sister.

915
01:29:25,857 --> 01:29:27,897
Miss Elizabeth!

916
01:29:32,531 --> 01:29:34,488
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

917
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,823
My brother has told me
so much about you,

918
01:29:37,035 --> 01:29:40,036
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

919
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:43,539
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

920
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,707
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

921
01:29:45,877 --> 01:29:49,128
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

922
01:29:50,257 --> 01:29:53,174
He once had to put up with my playing.

923
01:29:53,343 --> 01:29:58,052
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

924
01:29:58,223 --> 01:30:01,390
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

925
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,268
I'm satisfied.

926
01:30:09,526 --> 01:30:12,444
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

927
01:30:12,612 --> 01:30:15,400
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

928
01:30:15,574 --> 01:30:18,112
Its occupants have been left
in peace too long.

929
01:30:18,285 --> 01:30:22,496
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

930
01:30:22,664 --> 01:30:27,871
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

931
01:30:28,086 --> 01:30:31,835
Splendid fishing, good
company. What a capital fellow.

932
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:35,008
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

933
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:39,135
A letter for you, madam.

934
01:30:39,306 --> 01:30:41,180
Oh, it's from Jane.

935
01:31:05,707 --> 01:31:07,830
It is the most dreadful news.

936
01:31:10,295 --> 01:31:12,502
Lydia has run away...

937
01:31:15,384 --> 01:31:17,175
...with Mr Wickham.

938
01:31:17,344 --> 01:31:19,218
They are gone to Lord knows where.

939
01:31:19,388 --> 01:31:25,390
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

940
01:31:28,939 --> 01:31:30,813
This is my fault.

941
01:31:31,024 --> 01:31:34,524
If only I had exposed Wickham
when I should.

942
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:37,695
No, this is my fault.

943
01:31:37,906 --> 01:31:41,156
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

944
01:31:42,119 --> 01:31:45,120
Has anything been done to recover her?

945
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:50,372
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

946
01:31:52,379 --> 01:31:55,214
We have not the smallest hope.

947
01:31:55,382 --> 01:31:57,256
Would I could help you.

948
01:31:57,426 --> 01:31:59,632
Sir, I think it is too late.

949
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:07,388
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

950
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:09,518
We must go at once.

951
01:32:09,688 --> 01:32:13,436
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia
before she ruins the family.

952
01:32:41,094 --> 01:32:45,970
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

953
01:32:46,141 --> 01:32:49,308
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

954
01:32:49,519 --> 01:32:52,769
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

955
01:32:52,981 --> 01:32:58,355
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

956
01:32:58,528 --> 01:33:02,028
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

957
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,783
and then be killed.

958
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,824
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

959
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:08,823
Mr Collins will turn us out
before he is cold.

960
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:12,912
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

961
01:33:13,126 --> 01:33:18,334
Lydia must know
what this must be doing to my nerves.

962
01:33:18,548 --> 01:33:23,756
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

963
01:33:25,639 --> 01:33:29,471
My baby Lydia, my baby!

964
01:33:29,685 --> 01:33:34,181
How could she do such a thing
to her poor mama?

965
01:33:35,315 --> 01:33:37,771
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

966
01:33:37,984 --> 01:33:40,654
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

967
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:42,445
It's addressed to Papa.

968
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:45,941
It's in Uncle's writing.

969
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,906
Papa, there's a letter.

970
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:52,495
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

971
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:59,252
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

972
01:33:59,423 --> 01:34:01,878
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

973
01:34:02,092 --> 01:34:03,337
Are they married?

974
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:08,053
They will be if Father settles 100
a year on her. That is his condition.

975
01:34:08,223 --> 01:34:11,058
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

976
01:34:11,226 --> 01:34:15,603
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

977
01:34:15,814 --> 01:34:16,977
What do you mean?

978
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:19,022
No man would marry Lydia

979
01:34:19,234 --> 01:34:23,398
under so slight
a temptation as 100 a year.

980
01:34:23,572 --> 01:34:26,241
Your uncle must've been very generous.

981
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:29,531
Do you think it a large sum?

982
01:34:29,703 --> 01:34:32,870
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than 10,000.

983
01:34:33,081 --> 01:34:35,868
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

984
01:34:37,502 --> 01:34:41,963
Lydia married and at 15 too!

985
01:34:42,174 --> 01:34:44,047
Ring the bell, Kitty.

986
01:34:44,259 --> 01:34:48,720
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

987
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:51,635
Tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

988
01:34:51,808 --> 01:34:54,595
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

989
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:58,269
He's far richer than us
and has no children. Daughter married!

990
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,397
Is that really all you think about?

991
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:04,481
When you have five daughters, tell me
what else will occupy your thoughts.

992
01:35:04,696 --> 01:35:06,488
Then perhaps you'll understand.

993
01:35:07,824 --> 01:35:10,659
You don't know what he's like.

994
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,241
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

995
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:20,375
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

996
01:35:20,587 --> 01:35:24,419
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

997
01:35:24,633 --> 01:35:27,550
Then I bowed and smiled
like anything...

998
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:32,346
I'm sure she was not
half as radiant as you, my dear.

999
01:35:32,516 --> 01:35:34,639
You must all go to Brighton.

1000
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:38,434
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

1001
01:35:38,647 --> 01:35:40,106
Lydia.

1002
01:35:40,273 --> 01:35:44,485
I want to hear
every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1003
01:35:44,653 --> 01:35:47,654
I've been enlisted
in a regiment in the North of England.

1004
01:35:47,823 --> 01:35:49,447
Glad to hear it.

1005
01:35:49,616 --> 01:35:52,866
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1006
01:35:53,036 --> 01:35:57,081
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1007
01:35:57,249 --> 01:36:00,084
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1008
01:36:00,252 --> 01:36:01,414
I don't want to hear.

1009
01:36:01,586 --> 01:36:05,169
There was my aunt preaching away
as if reading a sermon.

1010
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:09,047
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1011
01:36:09,261 --> 01:36:13,508
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1012
01:36:13,682 --> 01:36:16,351
I longed to know if
he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1013
01:36:16,518 --> 01:36:21,061
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1014
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:25,063
So I thought, who is to be
our best man if he doesn't come back?

1015
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:28,860
Lucky, he did,
or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1016
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:33,408
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

1017
01:36:33,577 --> 01:36:36,993
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1018
01:36:37,164 --> 01:36:40,081
He was the one that discovered us.

1019
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:45,042
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

1020
01:36:45,255 --> 01:36:47,129
But he told me not to tell.

1021
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,755
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1022
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:55,931
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty
as you sometimes.

1023
01:37:01,563 --> 01:37:04,647
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1024
01:37:04,858 --> 01:37:06,981
Write to me often, my dear.

1025
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:10,278
Married women
never have much time for writing.

1026
01:37:10,447 --> 01:37:12,321
I dare say you won't.

1027
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:17,490
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

1028
01:37:19,164 --> 01:37:24,040
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

1029
01:37:31,176 --> 01:37:35,221
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

1030
01:37:36,223 --> 01:37:40,055
One seems so forlorn without them.

1031
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:49,606
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1032
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:53,859
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1033
01:37:59,788 --> 01:38:02,955
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

1034
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:05,040
Mrs Bennet.

1035
01:38:06,128 --> 01:38:10,837
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1036
01:38:11,008 --> 01:38:15,136
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1037
01:38:15,303 --> 01:38:17,676
Tomorrow?

1038
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:20,427
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1039
01:38:20,642 --> 01:38:23,892
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

1040
01:38:24,062 --> 01:38:28,440
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1041
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:33,526
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

1042
01:38:35,532 --> 01:38:40,490
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1043
01:38:41,455 --> 01:38:45,749
We better go home at once
and tell Mr Bennet.

1044
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:49,832
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

1045
01:38:50,005 --> 01:38:52,044
It's all right, Lizzie.

1046
01:38:52,215 --> 01:38:55,216
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

1047
01:38:55,385 --> 01:38:59,679
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1048
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,514
Oh, I'm sorry.

1049
01:39:35,842 --> 01:39:38,131
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1050
01:39:39,262 --> 01:39:42,347
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

1051
01:39:42,516 --> 01:39:45,517
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

1052
01:39:45,727 --> 01:39:48,349
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

1053
01:39:48,522 --> 01:39:52,104
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1054
01:39:52,317 --> 01:39:56,944
Mr Darcy? The insolence of
it. What does he think of, coming here?

1055
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:02,031
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at
once. Find some useful employment.

1056
01:40:03,412 --> 01:40:07,077
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

1057
01:40:07,249 --> 01:40:09,206
Kitty.

1058
01:40:09,376 --> 01:40:13,623
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1059
01:40:15,215 --> 01:40:19,842
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1060
01:40:23,557 --> 01:40:28,017
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1061
01:40:38,864 --> 01:40:41,569
How glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

1062
01:40:41,742 --> 01:40:44,411
There have been
many changes since you went away.

1063
01:40:44,578 --> 01:40:49,536
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

1064
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:51,582
You will have seen it in the papers,

1065
01:40:51,793 --> 01:40:54,331
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1066
01:40:54,546 --> 01:40:58,211
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1067
01:40:58,383 --> 01:41:01,218
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1068
01:41:01,386 --> 01:41:04,802
But it is very hard
to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1069
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:09,060
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1070
01:41:09,227 --> 01:41:11,101
Will you stay long in the country?

1071
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:13,519
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1072
01:41:13,732 --> 01:41:15,771
When you've killed all your own birds,

1073
01:41:15,942 --> 01:41:19,027
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

1074
01:41:19,196 --> 01:41:23,739
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

1075
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:26,406
Excellent.

1076
01:41:26,578 --> 01:41:30,492
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

1077
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:33,038
I hope the weather stays fine
for your sport.

1078
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:36,709
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

1079
01:41:38,382 --> 01:41:42,925
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1080
01:41:44,763 --> 01:41:46,886
She does indeed.

1081
01:41:54,272 --> 01:41:57,024
Well, we must be going, I think.

1082
01:41:57,734 --> 01:42:01,399
Darcy. It's been very pleasant
to see you all again.

1083
01:42:01,613 --> 01:42:03,570
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1084
01:42:03,782 --> 01:42:05,157
You must come again.

1085
01:42:05,325 --> 01:42:08,825
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

1086
01:42:09,037 --> 01:42:13,830
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1087
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:21,339
Excuse me.

1088
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,015
Most extraordinary.

1089
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:44,527
We were going to walk in
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1090
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,779
So, I feel...

1091
01:42:57,252 --> 01:42:59,043
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1092
01:42:59,254 --> 01:43:01,211
It's been...

1093
01:43:03,675 --> 01:43:05,798
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1094
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:08,798
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1095
01:43:08,972 --> 01:43:11,261
Yes, exactly.

1096
01:43:15,937 --> 01:43:19,686
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1097
01:43:19,858 --> 01:43:20,854
Oh, yes.

1098
01:43:21,068 --> 01:43:24,152
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1099
01:43:24,363 --> 01:43:28,195
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

1100
01:43:29,993 --> 01:43:34,536
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

1101
01:43:35,874 --> 01:43:36,953
Why ever not?

1102
01:43:39,795 --> 01:43:42,879
Jane.

1103
01:43:43,048 --> 01:43:47,924
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

1104
01:43:48,136 --> 01:43:50,888
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

1105
01:43:59,272 --> 01:44:01,230
I know this is all very untoward,

1106
01:44:01,441 --> 01:44:05,653
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1107
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,986
Alone.

1108
01:44:10,575 --> 01:44:13,826
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1109
01:44:13,996 --> 01:44:18,040
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1110
01:44:20,002 --> 01:44:25,043
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

1111
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:49,902
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1112
01:45:08,425 --> 01:45:09,884
Kitty, be quiet.

1113
01:45:22,272 --> 01:45:24,728
Yes.

1114
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,188
A thousand times yes.

1115
01:45:32,532 --> 01:45:36,032
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1116
01:46:22,374 --> 01:46:26,751
I am confident
they will do well together.

1117
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,918
Their tempers are much alike.

1118
01:46:32,009 --> 01:46:35,923
They will be cheated assiduously
by their servants.

1119
01:46:36,138 --> 01:46:42,306
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

1120
01:46:42,519 --> 01:46:47,062
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

1121
01:46:51,028 --> 01:46:54,527
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

1122
01:47:02,914 --> 01:47:05,370
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1123
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:09,207
She only can address herself effectually
to the feelings of others

1124
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:12,671
whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility

1125
01:47:12,883 --> 01:47:15,634
and whose arguments result
from conviction.

1126
01:47:15,802 --> 01:47:19,302
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1127
01:47:19,514 --> 01:47:22,681
which she wishes to inspire..."

1128
01:47:43,455 --> 01:47:45,744
Can you die of happiness?

1129
01:47:47,334 --> 01:47:50,335
He was ignorant
of my being in town in the spring.

1130
01:47:50,504 --> 01:47:53,588
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1131
01:47:53,757 --> 01:47:57,505
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1132
01:47:57,678 --> 01:48:03,264
Bravo. That's the most
unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1133
01:48:03,433 --> 01:48:05,640
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

1134
01:48:05,852 --> 01:48:08,141
If there was such a man for you.

1135
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:15,150
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1136
01:48:17,906 --> 01:48:19,780
- What is that?
- What?

1137
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:23,034
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1138
01:48:25,247 --> 01:48:27,370
Coming!

1139
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:31,871
Yes.

1140
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,920
Lady Catherine.

1141
01:48:41,596 --> 01:48:44,514
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1142
01:48:44,683 --> 01:48:48,431
All but one. The youngest
has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1143
01:48:48,603 --> 01:48:51,557
My eldest was proposed to
only this afternoon.

1144
01:48:53,442 --> 01:48:57,439
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1145
01:48:57,612 --> 01:49:01,028
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1146
01:49:01,867 --> 01:49:04,073
As a matter of urgency.

1147
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:11,373
You can be at no loss
to understand why I am here.

1148
01:49:11,543 --> 01:49:13,832
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1149
01:49:14,046 --> 01:49:18,257
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1150
01:49:18,425 --> 01:49:20,797
A most alarming report
has reached me.

1151
01:49:20,969 --> 01:49:25,512
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1152
01:49:25,682 --> 01:49:29,265
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

1153
01:49:29,478 --> 01:49:33,392
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

1154
01:49:33,565 --> 01:49:36,649
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

1155
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,188
To hear it contradicted.

1156
01:49:38,362 --> 01:49:41,777
Your coming will be a confirmation
if such a report exists.

1157
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:45,240
lf? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1158
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:48,411
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourself?

1159
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:50,454
I have never heard of it.

1160
01:49:50,666 --> 01:49:53,038
Can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

1161
01:49:53,251 --> 01:49:56,751
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1162
01:49:56,922 --> 01:50:00,006
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

1163
01:50:00,217 --> 01:50:02,505
Has my nephew
made you an offer of marriage?

1164
01:50:02,678 --> 01:50:05,762
Your Ladyship has declared it
to be impossible.

1165
01:50:05,931 --> 01:50:09,514
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

1166
01:50:09,685 --> 01:50:13,433
If that is the case, you cannot suppose
he would make an offer to me.

1167
01:50:13,605 --> 01:50:18,730
Selfish girl. This union
has been planned since their infancy.

1168
01:50:18,944 --> 01:50:22,277
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

1169
01:50:22,489 --> 01:50:26,950
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1170
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,410
only achieved
at the expense of your uncle.

1171
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:34,495
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1172
01:50:34,668 --> 01:50:37,206
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1173
01:50:40,674 --> 01:50:42,880
I am not.

1174
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,714
Will you promise never
to enter into such an engagement?

1175
01:50:46,888 --> 01:50:49,095
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1176
01:50:50,976 --> 01:50:53,265
You have insulted me
in every possible way

1177
01:50:53,478 --> 01:50:56,230
and can now have
nothing further to say.

1178
01:50:57,524 --> 01:51:00,229
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1179
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:03,857
Goodnight.

1180
01:51:05,866 --> 01:51:09,614
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

1181
01:51:10,829 --> 01:51:14,328
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

1182
01:51:14,499 --> 01:51:17,749
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

1183
01:54:07,297 --> 01:54:10,132
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1184
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:13,467
Yes, she was here.

1185
01:54:13,637 --> 01:54:16,804
How can I ever make amends
for such behaviour?

1186
01:54:16,973 --> 01:54:19,346
After what you've done for Lydia

1187
01:54:19,518 --> 01:54:22,851
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

1188
01:54:24,106 --> 01:54:28,981
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1189
01:54:31,446 --> 01:54:34,613
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1190
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:38,199
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

1191
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:41,075
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1192
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:47,582
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

1193
01:54:47,754 --> 01:54:50,755
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

1194
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:54,133
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

1195
01:54:59,349 --> 01:55:03,643
lf, however,
your feelings have changed...

1196
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,646
...I would have to tell you,

1197
01:55:08,859 --> 01:55:11,694
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

1198
01:55:11,862 --> 01:55:14,946
I love... I love you.

1199
01:55:15,115 --> 01:55:18,069
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

1200
01:55:29,755 --> 01:55:31,463
Well, then.

1201
01:55:36,386 --> 01:55:39,056
Your hands are cold.

1202
01:56:23,392 --> 01:56:25,349
Shut the door, please.

1203
01:56:36,279 --> 01:56:41,784
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

1204
01:56:41,952 --> 01:56:46,993
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

1205
01:56:47,207 --> 01:56:51,039
And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

1206
01:56:51,211 --> 01:56:53,667
But will that make you happy?

1207
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:57,961
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1208
01:56:58,135 --> 01:57:00,341
None at all.

1209
01:57:00,512 --> 01:57:05,388
We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1210
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,973
But this would be nothing
if you liked him.

1211
01:57:08,145 --> 01:57:09,853
I do like him.

1212
01:57:12,274 --> 01:57:13,816
I love him.

1213
01:57:16,945 --> 01:57:21,654
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

1214
01:57:25,037 --> 01:57:28,370
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

1215
01:57:28,582 --> 01:57:29,744
what he's done...

1216
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:32,790
What has he done?

1217
01:57:40,886 --> 01:57:44,634
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1218
01:57:44,848 --> 01:57:48,513
So did I. So did we all.

1219
01:57:48,685 --> 01:57:51,390
We must have been wrong.

1220
01:57:51,563 --> 01:57:57,103
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

1221
01:58:02,616 --> 01:58:04,407
Good Lord.

1222
01:58:07,037 --> 01:58:11,082
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1223
01:58:11,249 --> 01:58:14,832
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1224
01:58:15,045 --> 01:58:19,339
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1225
01:58:19,549 --> 01:58:22,883
Not just in this matter.

1226
01:58:23,053 --> 01:58:25,722
I've been nonsensical.

1227
01:58:25,889 --> 01:58:30,847
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

1228
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:34,477
But then, so have I.

1229
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:40,152
You see, he and I are...

1230
01:58:42,406 --> 01:58:45,572
He and I are so similar.

1231
01:58:45,784 --> 01:58:49,118
We're both so stubborn.

1232
01:58:50,789 --> 01:58:52,497
Papa, I...

1233
01:58:56,461 --> 01:58:58,833
You really do love him, don't you?

1234
01:59:00,298 --> 01:59:02,587
Very much.

1235
01:59:07,014 --> 01:59:12,767
I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you.

1236
01:59:12,936 --> 01:59:17,148
But it seems I am overruled.

1237
01:59:17,315 --> 01:59:21,942
So I heartily give my consent.

1238
01:59:30,329 --> 01:59:35,204
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1239
01:59:38,545 --> 01:59:39,541
Thank you.

1240
01:59:53,518 --> 01:59:58,145
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1241
01:59:58,357 --> 02:00:00,894
I'm quite at my leisure.

1242
02:00:10,202 --> 02:00:16,458
